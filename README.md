# php-stuff

php-signup-login-main1 is my practice stuff (also the css there is not mine), i am planning for "q" to be my finished product, complete with the php and css i'm satisfied with.

you will have to use this with xampp and create a database named `website_db`, then you will have to enter the sql code in `sql.sql`.
